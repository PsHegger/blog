My name is Gergely Heged√ºs and I'm from Budapest, Hungary. I've been working as a software developer since 2013 when I started as an Android developer at a small startup.

Like many other startups, this one couldn't convince people to use its product so we had to pivot toward developing software for other companies. It was around this time when I started promoting Kotlin for Android development and we finished our first Kotlin only app just a bit after the official 1.0 release. Since then I only ever write Java code if I must for some reason as I truly believe that Kotlin is better in every aspect.

In the meantime, we got more and more projects, but we didn't have enough people so I started to work on backend development too. This is when I learned Rails and Node.js

I left this company after more than 5 years to find new challenges and I started working at another small company at the start of 2019. We were working as a contractor for other companies, most notably for [Tier](https://www.tier.app/) who treated us like any of their own employees. I quickly became one of the first Android developers of their [consumer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tier.app), and even though I worked on other Tier related products too, I spent most of my time with that application. They acquired the company I was working for in 2021, so after that I became a full time Tier employee.

I stayed there for one more year, when I moved on to a new job, working on the Disney+ Hotstar app. It didn't last for long, since my wife and I decided, that we would like to continue our life outside of Hungary.

We moved to Munich at the end of Octoober 2022, and since than I'm working at United Internet, developing their email applications.
