My name is Gergely Hegedüs and I'm from Budapest, Hungary. I've been working as a software developer since 2013 when I started as an Android developer at a small startup.

Like many other startups, this one couldn't convince people to use its product so we had to pivot toward developing software for other companies. It was around this time when I started promoting Kotlin for Android development and we finished our first Kotlin only app just a bit after the official 1.0 release. Since then I only ever write Java code if I must for some reason as I truly believe that Kotlin is better in every aspect.

In the meantime, we got more and more projects, but we didn't have enough people so I started to work on backend development too. This is when I learned Rails and Node.js

I left this company after more than 5 years to find new challenges and I started working at another small company ([Makery](https://www.makery.co/)) at the start of 2019.

At this time this company had even fewer employees than my previous one, but they still managed to work on great projects with well-known companies, which was really attractive to me.

Since then I had the chance to work on bigger scale projects than ever (one of our apps has **1m+ downloads** with a vast amount of active users) and in the meantime learn new things like Micronaut.
